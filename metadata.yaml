description: 'Trollope''s third novel, and his only excursion into historical fiction,
  takes place during the French Revolution. Agatha de Larochejacquelin has two suitors:
  an aristocrat and a revolutionary peasant leader. The latter, ironically, is killed
  while fighting for the very restructuring of society that would have permitted him
  to marry an upper-class woman like Agatha. In this uncharacteristically violent
  novel, Trollope reveals more sympathy with the Royalist cause than with the revolutionaries.'
